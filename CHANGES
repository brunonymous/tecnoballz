 Thanks to Celelibi for bug reports. 
Close file tecnoballz.conf after creation.

Thank to to GitHub user dmitrysmagin for the following fixes:
 Create tecnoballz.conf with default values if it's absent.
 Remove forgotten SCROREFILE define from tecnoballz.h
 Remove some WIN32-specific code in creation of tecnoballz.hi
  (not needed, common code works)
 Remove checking for malloc as it checks not for malloc presence
  but if malloc(0) returns valid pointer. And malloc is not used
  at all in game code.
 Don't rely on SDL_mixer using libmikmod. As on different platforms
  it may use libmodplug. Instead, use mikmod directly for music and
  catch output with Mix_HookMusic().
  This is pretty hacky as 'no sound' driver is used with
  direct calling to VC_WriteBytes() to fill the buffer.
  MikMod_RegisterAllLoaders() fail for some platforms so use
  MikMod_RegisterLoader() separately.
